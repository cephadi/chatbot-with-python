Tips For Create ChatBot with Python :
1. create a dictionary containing common 
greetings as keys and their response as value
Ex : {"hai": "Hello, My name is Sudo, and i am your new virtual assistant"}

2. Set 5 to 10 basic questions and their answer
Ex : What time is it?

3. For external questions, you can use modules like wikipedia or webbrowser
Ex : Who is Bill Gates?

4. Try to use module like PYTTSX3 for text to speech conversion

5. Use modules like speech recognation for voice commands

This was the basic logic for a chatbot dude, now define your own logic.
